# AI_SAST_Tool
A Static Application Security Testing tool with AI integration
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my AI-powered Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool project. This tool is designed to help developers like us find security vulnerabilities in code using both static analysis and artificial intelligence.
What This Project Is About

I'm building a SAST tool that will scan code to detect security issues, such as SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities. The cool part is that I'm integrating a pre-trained language model (like GPT) to make the tool smarterâ€”it won't just find existing issues, but also predict potential future problems based on how the code evolves.
Features

    Static Code Analysis: The tool uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis to parse and analyze code for vulnerabilities.
    AI Integration: I'm using AI to understand the context of the code and provide more accurate security assessments.
    Dynamic Analysis (Coming Soon): I'll be adding a feature to simulate code execution in a controlled environment, making the analysis even more comprehensive.
    User-Friendly Interface: Whether you prefer a command-line tool or a simple web interface, I've got you covered (this feature is in progress).
